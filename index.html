    <h1>Natalie M. Hicks</h1>
    <h2>welcome to the family</h2>

<p><br />
First, I want to say thank you.<br /><br />
A simple statement with more meaning than I have words for. You’ve chosen to love and cherish, not only my brother, but his two beautiful children as well. As his big sister, (and Kyla and Radley’s auntie) I’m so incredibly happy that they have found you. You take on the role of wife and bonus-mom with so much kindness, patience and grace that I am left in awe of you.<br /><br />
Although you are my sister-in-law by chance, you are my friend by choice. Since the night I met you, you have introduced me to new and exciting things, been there for me through more than one breakup, and have given me many, many laughs. I will always cherish sneaking out of family functions with you for a bit of “alone time” before dinner. Those conversations are always full of life and love, much like you.<br /><br />
You wouldn’t be an official part of the Hicks family unless you had your very own .COM. It doesn’t look like much now, but whenever you’re ready, we can build it into something you love. It is my way of saying thank you for loving my brother and the rest of our family so fiercely.<br />
<br />
Your Sister-In-Law & Friend,<br />
Erin<br />
